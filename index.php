          Thank you, for visiting. As you can probably tell from the giant font above, my name is Adam Winter.  I'm a husband and a father of one nine-year-old.
          Professionally, I've been self-employed in the music industry for more than 10 years.  As such, I've employed much of my software development skills, IT knowledge, and science background.
          A few years ago, I developed an entire booking system that hundreds of Seattle's local musicians have used to book and pay for my services.  
          I use an AWS server that I built for this, but I also have a rack of servers at my facilities, which hosts many other services.
          Though I'm a Cisco Certified Network Associate, and I studied Physics at Seattle Pacific University, I have a particular interest in software development and devops.
          So, I've recently gone back to school, and I'm currently in the Bachelor Software Development program at Green River College, as a junior (again).
          So far, this experience is filling in many gaps in my knowledge, but also solidifying many things that I've learned on my own along the way.  
          I look forward to the opportunities that all of these experiences will provide.  Please, have a look around, and feel free to reach out.
        </p>
